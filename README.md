### DVP Token

#### Definition

DVP Token is the only accepted digital currency in the DVP ecosystem, and there will be no more additional issuance. Currently, any DVP network payment, reward and deposit pledge must be paid by DVP Token. DVP Token will be used to the payment of rewarding community members and provide them with financial flows.

**Amount**: 5,000,000,000
**Symbol**: DVP
#### ERC20 Design Introduction
- Supporting lockout: Locking a certain amount of tokens according to the
allocator designed in the white paper and releasing them on a quarterly basis.

- Weakening authority: There is an owner account for the token, but the
owner account has only the privilege of suspending trading (can be used after
the mainnet is online), which cannot have any effect on the user's assets and
eliminate the single point of threat.

- High security: The token contracts have been audited and reinforced by
numbers of professional blockchain security companies and it is extremely high
secured.For details, please see [DVPToken_contract_audit_report](https://github.com/DVPNET/DVP-TOKEN/blob/master/DVPToken_contract_audit_report.pdf).
- Constant aggregate: There is no design for destruction and
issuance, so the total amount of tokens is fixed.1.3 Usage1.3.1 for the
blockchain projects to issue a bounty deposit

#### Usage

- for the blockchain projects to issue a bounty deposit;

- to pay for the vulnerability bounty;

- to maintain ecological operations, such as development, promotion, and so on;

#### 2 Phases of DVP Implementation

Phase 1: The ERC20 token based on Ethereum will be issued.

Phase 2: The ideal mode of DVP is using its own public chain technology to store all the tokens directly on the blockchain to form an incentive network.

#### Community Rewarding

In the " vulnerability is mining " mechanism, every item needs to pay $50,000 equivalent to DVP as security deposit. Each vulnerability payment will be withdrawn 10% as the DVP fund and be settled at 00:00 on the last day of each month, in which 80% of the DVP fund is used as rewarding to DVP holders and 20% is used to reward the top 100 vulnerability submitters every month.
